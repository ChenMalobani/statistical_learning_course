# Statistical Learning - Course by Adi Sarid
This repository contains a corporate training course in Statistical Learning, composed by Adi Sarid.

This repository contains a corporate training course in statistical learning with R. 
The course deals with supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, and mixes theory and practice, using R.
The course was developed by Adi Sarid, of the Sarid Research Institute LTD.

# Syllabus

The course covers the following topics:

   * Overview of supervised learning: assessing model accuracy, regression versus classification.
   * Regression methods: OLS, shrinkage methods (the ridge and the lasso), variable selection, dimension reduction w/ PCA, quantile regression, outlier detection.
   * Linear methods for classification: logistic regression, LDA, QDA, SVM.
   * Revisiting model assessment and model selection: overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, cross validation, bootstrapping.
   * Classification and regression trees: the theory, generalization to random forests, bagging, boosting.
   * Neural networks: model basics, how they work, introduction to deep learning.
   * Unsupervised learning: KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering (theory and algorithms), distance functions, scaling and centering, examples.
